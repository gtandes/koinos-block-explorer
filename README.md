This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install packages using:

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn
```

Second, create a .env or .env.local file, add the following variables, and give substitute the proper values:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_ID=

NEXT_PUBLIC_WHITELISTED_ACCOUNTS=address1,address2,address3
```

Get your NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_ID by creating a free WalletConnect cloud project at https://cloud.walletconnect.com

Third, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
